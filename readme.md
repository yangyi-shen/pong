# pong

A replica of the classic pong arcade game, made with the Godot game engine and C#.

This is the first complete video game I've ever made, and the first project I've ever worked on with Godot! Hopefully the first of many.

The game meets the "goals" + "stretch goals" specified on the [20 games challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/) website, under "1. Pong".
